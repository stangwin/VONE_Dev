üßπ Final Cleanup Tasks Before Deployment ‚Äì Sprint 1.2.1

Execute these final UI cleanup tasks in the development environment ONLY. Do not modify the production environment.

---

‚úÖ 1. FIX BROKEN CUSTOMER DETAIL VIEW
- Clicking a customer name in the table should open the customer detail page.
- Confirm that `app.showCustomerDetail()` is being properly called and routed.
- If broken due to missing event binding or selector issue, fix immediately.

---

‚úÖ 2. FILES ICON CAUSING TALL ROWS
- The Files column is **forcing excessive vertical height**.
- Reduce icon to no more than **16x16 pixels** max.
- Set:
  - `padding: 0`
  - `margin: 0`
  - `line-height: 1.2`
  - `vertical-align: middle`
  - Apply `display: inline-flex; align-items: center;`
- Final result: **Row height should remain consistent** whether or not the Files icon is present.

---

‚úÖ 3. "NEXT STEP DUE" COLUMN WIDTH
- Rename column header from `Next Step Due` ‚ûù `Due`
- Limit the width of the "Due" column with CSS (`max-width: 100px`) to avoid wasting table space.

---

‚úÖ 4. COLUMN ALIGNMENT FIXES
- AE and Affiliate column headers do **not align** with their data.
- AE header is **left-justified**, while values are right-justified or center-aligned.
- Fix alignment for **both AE and Affiliate** columns:
  - Choose **center-aligned** for both headers and values (preferred)
  - Or, **left-align everything consistently** ‚Äì header and cell values

---

‚úÖ 5. LEFT NAVIGATION PADDING / VISUAL BULK
- The left-side Quick Actions menu is visually heavy.
- Reduce its visual footprint by adjusting:
  - `padding-left` / `padding-right`
  - Line spacing between groups (less space between section titles and buttons)
  - Reduce button height slightly (`padding: 6px 12px`)
- Leave behavior/functionality unchanged ‚Äì just optimize visual footprint.

---

üß™ When all tasks are complete:
- Restart the **development** server only.
- Validate that all fixes work properly without touching production.
- Do **not deploy** until prompted.
