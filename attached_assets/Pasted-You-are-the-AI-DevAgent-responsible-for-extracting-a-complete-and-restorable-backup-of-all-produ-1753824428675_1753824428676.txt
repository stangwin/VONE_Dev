You are the AI DevAgent responsible for extracting a **complete and restorable backup** of all production data from the live deployed version of the VONE CRM.

üßæ EXPORT GOAL:
Create a fully structured archive of **all production data**, including:
- All customer records
- Notes, files, and images **clearly mapped to the correct customer**
- Affiliates, AEs, and any quote or product associations
- All media/files packaged and linked

üì¶ REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

1. `customers.json` or `.csv`
   - All fields from the `customers` table
   - Must include stable `customer_id` for mapping

2. `customer_notes.json`
   - Every note entry
   - Must include `customer_id`, `timestamp`, `author`, `note_type`

3. `customer_files.json`
   - File metadata: filename, type, tags, customer_id, uploaded_by, upload_date

4. `affiliates.json` + `affiliate_aes.json`

5. If available:
   - `quotes.json`, `quote_items.json`, `products.json`

6. üìÅ `uploads/` directory (or similar):
   - All image and file assets (e.g., `.HEIC`, `.JPG`, `.PDF`)
   - Filenames must include or map back to customer_id via customer_files.json
   - Create index file `media_index.json` if helpful

üìå CRITICAL: Maintain Relationships
- Every note/file must be **traceable back to its originating customer**
- Use `customer_id` or explicit foreign keys
- Confirm that nothing is orphaned

üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Are We Missing Anything?
- Scan all production tables for other customer-linked data
- If additional tables exist (e.g., `tasks`, `events`, `logs`) that are tied to a customer, **include them**
- If there are join tables (e.g., `customer_affiliates`, `customer_premises`), export those too

üß™ Validation:
- At least 15 customers with full records
- 30+ files and photos properly tagged
- Notes with timestamps
- Affiliate mapping and AE links
- File preview validation (openable)

üéØ Final Output:
- `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file named: `vone_production_export_2025-07-29.tar.gz`
- Contain all table exports and file directory
- Place in Replit file tree for download OR upload to a temporary service like transfer.sh and return the link

‚ö†Ô∏è THIS MUST COME FROM PRODUCTION DATABASE ONLY.
Do **not** include development data or test records.

Confirm when the archive is ready.
