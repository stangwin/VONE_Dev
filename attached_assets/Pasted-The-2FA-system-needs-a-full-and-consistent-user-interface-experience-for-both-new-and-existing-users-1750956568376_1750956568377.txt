The 2FA system needs a full and consistent user interface experience for both new and existing users, aligned with the backend implementation. Please implement the following full 2FA scope into the CRM: 1) For Existing Users: In each user’s profile or account settings page, add a clear “Two-Factor Authentication” section. If 2FA is not enabled, show a button: “Enable 2FA.” When clicked, require password confirmation, then display a QR code for scanning into an authenticator app (TOTP-based), a backup key, and a confirmation field for the 6-digit code. Once confirmed, toggle two_factor_enabled to true in the database. Also allow the user to “Disable 2FA” from the same section. 2) For New Users: Allow optional 2FA setup during onboarding. Admins should have the ability to require 2FA upon registration if desired (add toggle in admin settings). 3) Login Flow: If two_factor_enabled = true for the user, then after normal email/password login, prompt for the 6-digit TOTP code. Verify it before allowing access to the dashboard. Show proper error messaging on failure and optionally implement lockout after multiple failed attempts. 4) Admin Controls: On the user management table (/admin/users or similar), display an indicator if 2FA is enabled for each user. Include a toggle to force enable/disable 2FA for any user. Also add an admin setting for “Enforce 2FA for all users.” 5) Backup Recovery: (Future enhancement) Give users 5 backup codes stored hashed in the DB. They can be used in place of TOTP if the device is lost. Track which have been used. 6) Design: Follow the same design language as the rest of the CRM (HubSpot-style). Place the 2FA section in a clearly labeled card or collapsible section. Use modal windows for QR and confirmation where needed. 7) Mobile Support: Ensure the QR code and code entry process works cleanly on both desktop and mobile screens. 8) Testing Accounts: Ensure demo users (e.g. demo@demo.com) can test enabling/disabling 2FA without interfering with other testers. Reset state automatically on logout for demo users.
