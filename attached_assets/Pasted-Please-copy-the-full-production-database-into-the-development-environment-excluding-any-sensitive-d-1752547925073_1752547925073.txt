Please copy the full production database into the development environment (excluding any sensitive data if necessary) and begin a comprehensive simulation of end-user interactions across every current VONE feature and function. You are to act as if you are an end user, interacting with the system through the UI alone. Your goal is to test all current workflows, identify and resolve anything broken, and provide a report of suggested improvements without implementing those suggestions.

You must simulate real-world workflows and test every feature, including: logging in and out as both admin and non-admin users and confirming role-based behavior; customer management including adding, editing, and deleting customers, editing inline dashboard fields such as Company Name, Status, Next Step, Affiliate, Affiliate AE, Primary Contact, and Primary Contact Phone; confirm that phone number input is formatted to a standard 10-digit telephone format; ensure dropdowns populate correctly for status, next step, affiliate, and affiliate AE.

Confirm that when “Other (Custom)” is selected in the Next Step dropdown, the freeform text input appears and is properly styled with appropriate spacing. Test all dropdown options and validate expected behaviors including field requirements and visibility of appropriate inputs. Attempt to close a customer and verify that a required closing note modal appears and that the note is stored in the customer’s notes section after confirmation.

File upload functionality should be tested thoroughly including uploading .heic and other file types. Upload files to customers with multiple locations and confirm files can be tagged to or at least clearly labeled by location, with all uploaded files visible in both the dashboard and detail views.

Verify the affiliate management system in full. In the dashboard inline editor, selecting an affiliate should filter the AE dropdown to only show valid AEs for that affiliate. Confirm that “Add New Affiliate” is only available to admin users and that “Add New AE” is available to all users once an affiliate has been selected. Use the admin panel to add, edit, and remove affiliate companies and affiliate AEs, and confirm that these changes are reflected immediately in the dashboard editing dropdowns.

Ensure the dashboard sidebar bulk operations (status updates, next step, affiliate changes) work as expected. Validate that quick navigation filters and quick stats reflect current data correctly. Confirm that the entire layout is responsive and clean, and that the previously reported left-hand menu overlapping issue is fully resolved.

Any feature that is not working as intended should be debugged, fixed in dev, re-tested, and marked as complete. Do not alter features that are functioning correctly but could be improved. Instead, list any potential enhancements or ideas in a section titled “Suggested Improvements (Not Yet Implemented),” and provide a brief explanation and suggested approach for each.

When finished, provide a complete status checklist grouped by feature area, with each item marked as working, fixed, or suggested. Also include a short summary of unresolved suggestions requiring Stan’s review before implementation. Let me know once this is complete and the system is ready for staging review and promotion to production.
