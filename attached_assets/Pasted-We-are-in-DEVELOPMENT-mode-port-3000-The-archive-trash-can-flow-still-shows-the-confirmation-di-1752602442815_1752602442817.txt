We are in DEVELOPMENT mode (port 3000).  
The archive/trash-can flow still shows the confirmation dialog but leaves the row visible and makes no DB change.

1. Reproduce:
   ‚Ä¢ Refresh dev UI.  
   ‚Ä¢ Add a test customer ‚ÄúArchive Bug Dev‚Äù.  
   ‚Ä¢ Click üóë ‚Üí confirm.  
   ‚Ä¢ Observe: no fetch to /api/customers/:id DELETE or no row removal.

2. Debug & fix IN DEV ONLY:
   a. Frontend:
      ‚Äì Ensure renderCustomerList adds a delete button whose click handler  
        calls DatabaseAPI.deleteCustomer(id) with proper credentials:'include'.  
      ‚Äì Use an arrow function or bind to preserve `this`.  
      ‚Äì After success, remove the row (or refresh) and show toast.  
      ‚Äì Console-log any caught error.

   b. Network:
      ‚Äì Verify the DELETE request is sent (check DevTools/network).  
      ‚Äì Status must be 200 with `{ message:"Customer archived" }`.

   c. Server:
      ‚Äì Confirm route DELETE /api/customers/:id exists and
        ‚Ä¢ checks admin role,
        ‚Ä¢ sets deleted_at = NOW(),
        ‚Ä¢ returns JSON 200.  
      ‚Äì Log SQL run and resulting row count.

   d. Database:
      ‚Äì In vantix_dev.customers, verify deleted_at is set for the test row.  
      ‚Äì GET /api/customers must exclude rows where deleted_at IS NOT NULL.

3. Automated test:
   ‚Ä¢ With fetch (or curl) create customer X, delete it, list customers ‚Äì expect X absent.  
   ‚Ä¢ Repeat twice to ensure idempotent.

4. After dev fix passes:
   ‚Ä¢ Back up production DB.  
   ‚Ä¢ Switch to PRODUCTION mode (`./switch-to-production.sh`).  
   ‚Ä¢ Apply *only* the JS handler and (if needed) server route tweaks‚Äîno schema change.  
   ‚Ä¢ Run the same automated test in prod: create temp customer, archive, confirm disappearance.  
   ‚Ä¢ Roll back temp customer.

5. Report:
   ‚Ä¢ Exact lines changed in script.js and server.js.  
   ‚Ä¢ Confirmation that prod and dev both archive correctly, with before/after DB counts.

DO NOT touch any unrelated code or schema. Only implement the archive bug fix and verify. Return ‚Äú‚úî archive flow works in dev & prod‚Äù when done.
