Can't get the firewall to get an IP address and pick up on the network either. We have no access to anything that they're plugging in. There's something wrong with their existing firewall/router. It may be running off IP addresses or it may have some other issue. Voxo is looking into it now and they're waiting on credentials to come from Lumistry for the existing Dray Tech firewall..",
