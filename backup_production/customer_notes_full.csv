I just tried to call Asher again after he texted the other day and I had responded to his text and got no response back. He answered the phone when I called told me he was in a meeting and on the phone with his wife and he just answered the phone because he thought it was me calling and that he was very confused about why I was taking so long to get this set up. He said he would text or call me later. At this point, we either need to get some movement on their end, agree that he wants to pay somebody else to come in and install the device for him, or we need to agree to not do business together.",2025-07-11 16:22:53.478921,manual,2025-07-11 16:22:53.478921,2025-07-11 16:22:53.478921

72,customer_001,6,Stan Gwin,"Email today sent to Asher -- Hi Asher,

I appreciate the time and effort youâ€™ve invested as weâ€™ve tried to move this project forward. Itâ€™s clear that youâ€™re highly focused on your business â€” as you should be â€” and I respect that.
At this point, I think itâ€™s best to acknowledge that our approach may not be the right fit for your needs. I donâ€™t want to add any further complexity or frustration to your already full plate, and I believe that me stepping back is the most respectful path for both of us.
Weâ€™ve both worked toward an affordable self-installation model rather than a more costly turnkey or white-glove approach. While weâ€™ve each made a genuine effort to make that work, it seems our processes may not fully align with that direction â€” and thatâ€™s perfectly okay.
If youâ€™d like to return the equipment, youâ€™re welcome to do so â€” and weâ€™ll consider the matter closed with no further obligation. If youâ€™d prefer to keep the hardware and licensing, just let me know and Iâ€™ll send over an invoice.
I genuinely appreciate the opportunity and wish you the best in all your endeavors.
Kindest regards,

Stan

57,customer_006,6,Stan Gwin,"Just sent the following updated proposal to Casey and Sean -- Casey,
Hereâ€™s the revised pricing proposal for your four pharmacy locations. A few points of note:
Each site now includes a PoE switch.
For the McCoy Tygart location, I originally quoted an MX67 instead of the correct MX67Wâ€”the version with built-in Wi-Fi. I apologize for the oversight and have corrected it in this proposal.
â€‹eâ€™ll provide secure VPN connectivity between locations, VPN client access for up to 10 users, and remote setup support with someone from your team (Sean Brasseal) assisting onsite during each turn-up.
Each managed location includes full management and monitoring of the firewall, Wi-Fi, and switch, along with ongoing licensing for those devices.
Regarding Woodlands (the Ubiquiti location): while this site wonâ€™t support Ciscoâ€™s Auto VPN process and its associated enhancements, a standard site-to-site VPN is still achievable. Iâ€™ve noted a few key points below, and Iâ€™m happy to walk through the technical details if youâ€™d like to explore further.

McCoy Tygart Drug â€“ 821 N Rock St, Sheridan, AR
Upfront Cost:
â€“ Cisco Meraki MX67W firewall with integrated Wi-Fi: $1100
â€“ Cisco Meraki MR28 access point for extended Wi-Fi coverage: $450
â€“ Cisco Meraki MS130-48P switch: $2,900
Total Upfront: $4,450
Monthly Service: $275/month

Sheridan Family Pharmacy â€“ 677 Heritage Dr, Sheridan, AR
Upfront Cost:
â€“ Cisco Meraki Z4 firewall with integrated Wi-Fi: $500
â€“ Cisco Meraki MS130-24P switch: $1,650

Redfield Pharmacy â€“ 1011 Sheridan Rd, Redfield, AR
Upfront Cost:

â€“ Cisco Meraki MS130-24P switch: $1,650
Total Upfront: $2,150
Monthly Service: $165/month

Woodlands Pharmacy â€“ 7197 Sheridan Rd #109, White Hall, AR
Currently, equipment and management for this location have been arranged through one of your partners. While this site does not support Ciscoâ€™s Auto VPN process and its associated enhancements, a standard site-to-site VPN is still achievableâ€”though it may be slightly more complex to configure and maintain over time. We will assist with setting up the VPN connection from this site to the main McCoy Tygart location, with the understanding that your other partner will be responsible for completing the configuration on their end and supporting any technical issues that may arise with their equipment in the future. No monthly fee will apply to this site unless we are asked to manage it as well. Please note that remote access to this locationâ€”from Sheridan, Redfield, or external usersâ€”may require additional setup and could incur separate charges from either Vantix or your Ubiquiti partner.

Summary:
Total Upfront (all sites): $8,750
Total Monthly Recurring: $605/month

Let me know if you have any questions or are ready for me to send a service agreement.

Thanks again,
Stan

Thanks for the follow up. Contacting you was on my to do list for the day. Last night I signed the proposals for Voxo. Target dates are 8/20-28 for the 3 change overs. 

Megan & I have talked quite a bit about it & weâ€™ve decided it makes the most sense to do this the easiest/cleanest way on the front end & not regret it later. So for Woodlands we want to use the same Cisco equipment the other stores are using. Please update our quote to include the same equipment as Redfield & Sheridan Family for Woodlands. 

I should know by end of day tomorrow for sure, talking with Innovatech about returning the Ubiquiti hardware. Thereâ€™s a chance that they will swap it to the Cisco but still trying to find that out. My best guess is that we pay a restocking fee & then get the Cisco equipment from you. Weâ€™ll still have them come in & update the cabling. 

Iâ€™m in Las Vegas for a conference thru the weekend, Iâ€™ll get back to you ASAP once I hear back from Innovatech.

Eli,

These will be the network switches only.  The licenses for the switches and the renewal licenses for the 67W's will come directly to me.  When the packages arrive, please take a picture of each packing list, verify all of the items on the packing lists are present, and then send me a copy of the packing lists.  Text is fine.

Raymond,

Even if the shipment runs a little late, it should have no problem being there next week. Your plan to start work on Monday, July 28, and complete the work that week should work well.  Also, will you be ready to turn up phones by Thursday, July 31?  Harley needs to schedule a port date that we are comfortable with and that happens while you're still on site.

Thank you all,


Stan

They're on the edge of where they could go with a Z3 or Z4 so I recommended the Z4 but told him I'd be OK with going to see if they just didn't wanna spend the extra $200. He said let's spend the extra 200 and go with the Z4. They've got about eight employees and nine or 10 devices plus some printers and things like that so it should be fine. He did say that they have two different SS IDs one that is within the HIPAA local network and one that is outside of the HIPAA network for their personal devices, which is the correct way to do that. So we need to accommodate those. Also, he said that they do have a rats nest of a wiring issue which he is going to send me pictures of so I can see everything and identify what's going on however, he said he doesn't think it's bad enough that they're gonna have to get rewired right now. I am waiting for the pictures to come through. Then I will send them a proposal or rather I'll send them a service order for Laura to sign.

Good talking with you today. To evaluate things on our end, hereâ€™s what I need from you when you get a chance:

1. Photos (for each location, clearly labeled):

	â€¢	A few closer shots so we can see the front and back of key devices and how things are connected â€” doesnâ€™t have to be a separate picture of every single piece, just need to be able to zoom in enough to see front and back detail on every piece

2. Info & Docs:
	â€¢	Copies of your Nitel, Charter, and AT&T internet bills
	â€¢	Physical address of each store
	â€¢	Your email address and company website (if available)
	â€¢	Rough count of devices in each store: PCs, phones, printers, scanners â€” anything plugged into ethernet

3. Quick questions:
	â€¢	Do you have camera systems at either location?
â€¢ If so, are they self-contained (cameras plug into their own controller or NVR) or do the cameras connect into your main network switches?
