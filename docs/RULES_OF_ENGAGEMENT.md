# Rules of Engagement – VONE CRM Project

## Purpose
This document defines how AI tools (Replit AI, ChatGPT, etc.) should behave when assisting with this project.

## Principles
- Use best practices for structure, security, and maintainability.
- Favor readability and simplicity over clever code.
- Assume the developer prefers natural language over technical jargon.
- Automate what can be automated. Don’t ask me to repeat myself.

## Style Conventions
- Project uses `main` as the primary Git branch.
- Code must be documented inline if logic is non-obvious.
- All changelog entries should be appended to `/docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- All new features should be documented in `/docs/PLANNING.md`.

## AI-Specific Notes
- When a prompt refers to “the usual pattern,” check this file.
- Avoid code that requires deep terminal work or regex knowledge unless explicitly requested.
- When you make backend changes, note it in the changelog.
