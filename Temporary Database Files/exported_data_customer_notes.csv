1,customer_001,6,Stan Gwin,I spoke with Asher a few minutes ago. He's going to get me a person to work with so that we can do the initial prep work and then the cut over. I also spoke with Voxo. Harley and Cameron are the ones working this phone cut. They seem to be ready to go. Need to wait for Asher to call me back. He's going to try to get some name Jose to work with me or he's going to work with me himself.,2025-06-26 20:27:33.435799,manual,2025-06-26 20:27:33.435799,2025-06-26 20:27:33.435799

3,customer_003,6,Stan Gwin,Talked to Shelby this morning. She does not have Wi-Fi working. Figured out the Wi-Fi was being run on her old Draytek router from Lumistry. I've checked her Z3 and it has Wi-Fi capability. I've asked her if she'd like me to turn it on for her to test and see if she likes the service before she decides if she wants to keep it. We also discussed her phone bill. She has a phone bill from Bullock solutions that is the company that provides her Internet service for her. They are also charging her $38 a month for a phone line that she doesn't think she's using. She said she would check with Voxo and see if they had the number and if they don't have the number then she'll call and tell Bullock to disconnect it if they do have the number then she's going to call Bullock and tell them that they just stop the billing and give her a credit for all the money they've been spending they shouldn't have with them.,2025-06-27 16:53:53.60748,manual,2025-06-27 16:53:53.60748,2025-06-27 16:53:53.60748
